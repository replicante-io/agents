    # If the actions system is enabled but HTTPS is not configured for mutual authentication
    # the agent process will refuse to start.
    #
    # By default the actions system is disabled unless HTTPS with mutual authentication is enabled.
    # When HTTPS with manual authentication is enabled the actions system is automatically enabled.

    # The network interface and port to bind the API server onto.

    # TLS (for HTTPS) certificates configuration.
    #
    # By default, the agent starts without TLS enabled and serves requests over HTTP.
    # Because this is an insecure channel and anyone could be making requests
    # **actions are disabled** unless **mutual client** certificate validation is performed.
    #
    # HTTPS without mutual authentication can also be enabled by providing the server
    # with a TLS certificate and a TLS private key but **actions will still be disabled**.

    # API versions or reduce attack surfices by removing endpoints that are not needed.
    #
    # Example use cases are:
    #
    #   * Upgrade prep: testing new API versions while having a quick rollback plan.
    #   * Controlled rollout: be prepared for when verions are no longer supported.
    #   * Disable unstable/experimental APIs: to enusre integrated tools only use stable APIs.
    trees:
      # Enable/disable the introspection APIs.

      introspect: true

  # Override the cluster display name, or set it if none was detected.

  # The cluster ID is used to uniquely identify the cluster across the system
  # but some datastores report random, machine generated, strings as IDs.
  # To make clusters more identifiable to Replicante users a display name is
  # used in messages/views when provided, using the cluster ID as a fallback.
  #
  # When a datastore does not auto-detect a display name or you wish to change the
  # auto-detected display name, use this field to set whatever you want.

  # The section below is for logging configuration.
  logging:
    # Flush logs asynchronously.
    # 
    # Pro:
    #     Async log flushing is more efficient as processes
    #     are not blocked waiting for logging backends to complete.
    # 
    # Con:
    #     If the process crashes logs in the buffer may be lost.
    #
    # Recommendation:
    #     Keep async logging enabled unless replicante is crashing
    #     and the logs don't have any indications of why.
    #
    #     Async logging may also be disabled in testing, debugging,
    #     or developing environments.

    level: info

    # Advanced level configuration by module prefix.
    #
    # The keys in this map are used as prefix matches against log event modules.
    # If a match is found the mapped level is used for the event.
    # If no match is found the `level` value is used as the filter.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #     modules:
    #       'hyper::server': debug
    #       'rdkafka': error
    #
    # To find out what modules are available you can set `level` to DEBUG
    # and enable `verbose` logging to see all logs.
    # Once you know what logs you are looking for you can undo the changes to `level` and `verbose`
    # and add the module prefix you need to the `modules` option.

    # To allow DEBUG level to be more useful, only application events are emitted at
    # DEBUG level while dependency events are emitted at INFO level.
