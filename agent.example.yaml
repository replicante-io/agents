  # The section below is for the API interface configuration.
  api:
    # The network interface and port to bind the API server onto.

  # The section below is for logging configuration.
  logging:
    # Flush logs asynchronously.
    # 
    # Pro:
    #     Async log flushing is more efficient as processes
    #     are not blocked waiting for logging backends to complete.
    # 
    # Con:
    #     If the process crashes logs in the buffer may be lost.
    #
    # Recommendation:
    #     Keep async logging enabled unless replicante is crashing
    #     and the logs don't have any indications of why.
    #
    #     Async logging may also be disabled in testing, debugging,
    #     or developing environments.
