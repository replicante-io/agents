# Golang SDK Placeholder
The advantage of agents is they don't have to be all (or at all) written in Rust.

Currently Rust was chosen to limit the complexity and the number of runtime to maintain.
Once the agent interface is stable and the SDK featureset is well defined,
a new [golang](https://golang.org/) SDK may be added to expand the agents ecosystem.
