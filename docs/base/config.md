# Configuration
As agents are delveloped as independent programs, configuration options
(and sometimes format) differ from agent to agent.

Official agents and those implemented using the base rust crate provide a set of standard
configuration options as well as agent specific options.
Below are the common agent options while agent specific options
are documented with the agents details.
