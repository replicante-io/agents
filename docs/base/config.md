# Configuration
As agents are delveloped as independent tools, configuration options
(and sometimes format) differ from agent to agent.

Official agents and those implemented using the base rust crate provide a set of standard
configuration options:

[import, lang:"yaml"](../../base/agent.example.yaml)
